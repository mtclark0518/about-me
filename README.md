# About Me

primarily general support but also probably interview prep

### Day 1 Goals:
Get a job in the dev field

### What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
* Product
* Agency
* Startup

I am a lot more concerned with the culture/atmosphere and companies view on employee development than I am with what the company is/does.

### What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
I am fully committed to learning the full stack proficiently enough to work in either role. If I were forced to pick one or the other I would say I'm leaning a little more towards the backend because it feels more like "real programming"... and from what i've heard they get paid more typically.
